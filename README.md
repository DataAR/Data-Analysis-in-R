A guide for learning the basic tools on data anaylisis: process, visualize and learn from your data using R programming.

This repository holds the necessary data sets for the book "An Introduction to Data Analysis in R", to be published by Springer series Use R!. The book can be purchased in XXX.

The book is meant as an introductory guide to manipulate data sets in the Big Data paradigm. One of the main goals of this book is to take the analyst from the very first moment when she/he contacts with data to the final conclusion and presentation of results of analysis. We take into account the variety of fields where data analysis occurs nowadays. We pay special attention to the different ways to obtain data and how to make it manageable before starting the analysis. The data analysis includes most of the basic visualization options and some advanced extra options. Finally, basic statistics and mathematical background is used to learn from the processed data. The text includes a crash course on programming, plus the needed data processing tools placing the analyst at the starting point to extract information from data. Through statistical analysis plus visualization of this information, many conclusions can be extracted to understand the meaning of a database.

The book has grown out of the authors experience teaching undergraduate students in Business degrees and in our personal research in different fields. Given the increasing demand on data analysis skills, our aim is to provide students with a complete guide on the basic tools and necessary practice to excel in their work.
